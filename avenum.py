#We could rewrite an earlier program that computed the average of a list of numbers
#entered by the user using a list.
#First, the program to compute an average without a list:

#In this program, we have count and total variables to keep the number and
#running total of the userâ€™s numbers as we repeatedly prompt the user for a number.
